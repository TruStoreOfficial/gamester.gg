# A collection of offline single-file HTML games.

A repo filled with 200 offline games that can each run on a single file. This is a good option if you are having internet connectivity issues, or you're at some place with restricted internet.


For installation: Download and extract the repository as a zip file to save all the games for offline use. It may take a while to download fully. ( ~ 2.8 GB decompressed)

The downside of inlining everything is the file size. For code editors, you can use chunks.py to split them. You can use https://github.com/CoolDude2349/schoolworkforall/blob/main/code-inputer2.html for loading the chunks.


The collection's updated regulary to add more offline games. Many more soon..


There's a single-file containing all the games but the games are located externally. It's recommended to store the game files in your downloads or Google Drive, then upload them to the single-file html (Supreme Math Lite)

You can download the zip files used in the single-file through the network tab.
