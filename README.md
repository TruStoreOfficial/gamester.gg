# A collection of offline HTML games.

A repo filled with 200 offline games that can each run on a single file. This is a good option if you are having internet connectivity issues, or you're at some place with restricted internet.


**Usage:** Download and extract the repository as a zip file to save all the games for offline use. It may take a while to download fully. ( ~ 2.8 GB decompressed)


The downside of inlining everything is the file size. If you're running the files via an online code editor, it may be better to use the single-file html.

The collection's updated regulary to add more offline games. Alot more soon..
